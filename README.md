Task 2 : focuses on adding an image to a webpage using HTML and CSS. You create a heading, insert an image with proper alt text, and write a short paragraph describing it. The task also teaches basic styling—such as resizing the image, centering it, and adding spacing—helping you understand how HTML and CSS work together.














Task 6 : introduces basic JavaScript by performing a simple addition operation. You create two variables, add them, and display the result directly on the webpage.
